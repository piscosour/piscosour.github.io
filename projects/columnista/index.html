<h3>&#60;columnista&#62;</h3>
<p>Columnista is a text generation system that produces short political columns in Spanish based on the Peruvian context.</p>

<p>The program selects from a pre-defined list of active "issues" discussed in the media and then automatically generates an opinion column commenting on the issue. Of course, the columns generated are not based on research or any actual evaluation, but rather just on a series of familiar tropes and positions that are common to political commentary in Peru. Columnista is an attempt to highlight just how meaningless most political commentary in Peruvian media has become.</p>
