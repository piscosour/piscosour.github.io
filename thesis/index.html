<p class="lead" style="text-align: center">My name is Eduardo Marisca and I recently finished my master's thesis in the <a href="http://cmsw.mit.edu">Comparative Media Studies program at MIT</a>, researching the emergence of the video game industry in Peru. This work is the result of several months of qualitative research carried out in Lima, Peru, primarily between May and August 2013, and is an effort to map the history and current configuration of the game industry in Lima, as well as its potential and challenges as it consolidates into a growing technology sector and creative industry.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align: center">The results of this research are available in multiple forms:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px"><a href="/files/EM-DGW-Final.pdf"><strong>Developing Game Worlds: Gaming, Technology, and Innovation in Peru.</strong></a> The main thesis document, an in-depth qualitative study on the Peruvian video game industry.</li>
<li style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px"><a href="/files/EM-DGW-ResearchSummary.pdf"><strong>Developing Game Worlds: Research Summary.</strong></a> A ten-page summary document including the abstract, key findings, as well as high-level conclusions and recommendations stemming from this research.</li>
<!--<li style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px"><strong>The Peruvian Gamedex</strong>. A pre-alpha tool I've developed to catalog and document the history of video games made in Peru (still in very early development and with unvalidated data).</li>

<p class="lead">This thesis project was evaluated by T.L. Taylor (my main advisor) and Ian Condry from the Comparative Media Studies program at MIT. This work is one of the few studies available on game industries in Latin America &mdash; at least that I've been able to find. And it also attempts to contribute some ideas about how to identify, map, and stregthen technology industries in developing economies by looking at the work of existing creative communities that are invisible to most measures and indicators.</p>
