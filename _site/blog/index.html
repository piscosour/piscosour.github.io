Only then did I realise it was not the spoon that bent, it was only myself --- that is, I realised the category was not as commonplace and clearly defined as I assumed it to be, and decided to go down the rabbit hole to pinpoint more clearly what I was trying to say when summoning the technological sublime as a conceptual Pokémon.</h2>

					<h1>How I'm Writing My Thesis</h1>
					<h2>Now that I'm getting heavily into the writing part of my thesis, I've had the chance to procrastinate on the actual writing by looking into multiple arrangements, setups, and tools to support my actual writing process. There are many things to manage when writing a thesis&#58; references, notes, drafts, citations, layouts, versioning, backups, and perhaps even more depending on your specific field. So I've decided to put together a quick walkthrough about my own process and workflow and how I've set up different tools across the research and writing process, along with links to additional resources.</h2>

					<h1>Assembling Agnes, Or How I Read Science Fiction</h1>
					<h2>As the sole representative of the MIT Comparative Media Studies program in the class, my approach at building prototypes and exploring science fiction themes for the SciFi2SciFab class is likely quite different than that of people at the Media Lab. For starters, I don't have a background on engineering or computer science, and my "making things" experience is limited. Which has made the class quite an interesting challenge, especially in trying to adapt what the experience of science fiction design means from my point of view.</h2>

					<h2>I've been reading a lot of science fiction lately, for an MIT Media Lab class I'm taking called Science Fiction to Science Fabrication.

					<h1>Meet Agnes</h1>
					<h2>Digital games have always received considerable influence from the science fiction world. Even really early games, like perhaps Space Invaders, in elementary ways were already drawing inspiration from sci-fi themes, and the trend has remained over time. One of the most interesting examples I can think of is the Portal games by Valve Software, which develop a very unconventional form of narrative&#58; lacking any cutscenes or narrative interludes to provide the player with explanations about what’s going on, the depth of the world in which you abruptly find yourself in is provided bit by bit by GLadOs, an initially friendly artificial intelligence which leads the protagonist through a series of physical test chambers in an otherwise deserted scientific facility.</h2>
