For the last three months I’ve been fortunate enough to meet and follow lots of people in the local video games industry as they crunch through games, try to open up markets and bring together the various players in the industry who have been scattered about for so long. Making games in Peru is not easy, and big challenges abound. But despite the perception many people have of games as risky business, there have been many efforts coming together in the last few months that point to very interesting prospects in this space. <a href="/2013/09/09/making-games-in-peru-5.html">(...)</a></p><br /></li>

Back in the day, when the community was just coming together it was built heavily on lax regulations regarding intellectual property rights. Software was hard to come by and very expensive when commercially available, which led to the emergence of quite active informal and illegal networks for circulating enterprise and entertainment software. Downtown Lima became the hot spot for acquiring all sorts of pirated software, in places such as Polvos Azules, a massive shopping center with endless collections of software, music, movies, and whatever other cultural commodity you can imagine. While crackdowns on pirated goods began happening in the nineties, widespread informal and illegal distribution channels remain even today as one of the reasons why the local games industry aims primarily at foreign rather than domestic markets, but also as perhaps the primary way through which local players can get access to the latest games way before they’re officially available, if they ever arrive. <a href="/2013/08/19/making-games-in-peru-4.html">(...)</a></p><br /></li>

The right conditions aren’t there&#58; skills are hard to acquire, financing is not readily available, and much better financial returns can be secured by looking elsewhere in the economy. There are so few incentives, and so many counter-incentives, it would seem rational people would turn to other things to earn their livelihood. <a href="/2013/07/29/making-games-in-peru-3.html">(...)</a></p><br /></li>

Success stories were short lived, and post mortems would routinely refer to underlying factors such as widespread piracy throughout the region as impeding any sustained growth or innovation. Without significant local audiences to buy and play locally developed games, the prospects for emerging communities of hackers and tinkerers, who were learning how to make games through various forms of reverse engineering, were grim. Some research even suggested that the only possible future for a games industry in Latin America given conditions at the time would be assembling consoles in the cheap labour-driven model of so-called “free trade zones”.<br /><br />Then in 2003, Steam happened. <a href="/2013/07/08/making-games-in-peru-2.html">(...)</a></p><br /></li>
			
	
		
			<li><p>[17 Jun 2013]<br /><a href="/2013/06/17/making-games-in-peru.html"><span class="lead">Making Games in Peru</span></a><br />I landed in Lima, Peru, about two weeks ago. Lima is where I’m originally from, and even though I get a chance to come back every few months, it keeps feeling more different every time. This time, though, I’m here on a mission&#58; thanks to the support of the Comparative Media Studies program here at MIT, for about two months I’m going to be tracking down and mapping out the local video game industry. Whenever I tell people about my research project, I usually get one of two reactions&#58; either lots of excitement and curiosity; or confused, blank stares, even when I’m talking to people from Peru. The video game industry has gone largely unnoticed, and it’s understandable. Even though similar development scenes have been growing for some time and garnering some attention in countries such as Argentina, or especially, Brazil, the Peruvian scene, and specifically the Lima scene, is just now coming together. But there have been studios operating locally for over a decade, and people and groups playing around with game development even further back. My job while I’m down here is to reconstruct this history and to better understand how the industry is growing today, and what a Peruvian gaming industry is starting to look like. <a href="/2013/06/17/making-games-in-peru.html">(...)</a></p><br /></li>

It was a pretty interesting event not without its share of controversial statements, as one could expect from a gathering of people discussing what the future of the gaming industry is going to look like. <a href="/2013/04/29/funding-game-projects.html">(...)</a></p><br /></li>
